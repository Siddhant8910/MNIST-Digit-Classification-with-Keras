# MNIST-Digit-Classification-with-Keras
This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple neural network implemented in TensorFlow and Keras.

Hereâ€™s a concise README for your MNIST digit classification project, including the model parameters and techniques used:

## Features

- **Loads and normalizes MNIST data**
- **Neural Network Architecture:**
  - Input: Flatten layer for 28x28 images
  - Hidden Layers: Dense (128 units, ReLU), Dense (64 units, ReLU)
  - Output: Dense (10 units, Softmax)
- **Training Parameters:**
  - Loss: `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`
  - Optimizer: `adam`
  - Metrics: `accuracy`
  - Epochs: 10
  - Validation split: 20% of training data
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data normalization (scaling pixel values to [0, - Multi-layer neural network (MLP)
  - Accuracy and validation monitoring
  - Visualization of accuracy over epochs
  - Test set prediction and evaluation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install with:
```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
2. Run the Python script or notebook.
3. View training results, accuracy curves, and test sample predictions.
