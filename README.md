# MNIST-Digit-Classification-with-Keras
This project uses a simple neural network built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model preprocesses the image data, trains on labeled examples, evaluates its accuracy, and provides visualizations of its learning curve and sample predictions.
